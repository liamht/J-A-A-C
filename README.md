# J-A-A-C (Just Another Android Calculator)
I got bored and wanted to make some nice xamarin UI one random afternoon

Don't read too much into the codebase, I did it all in the code behind instead of doing MVVM because: 
- Its a calculator... everyone can make a calculator
- I wanted to focus on the design and do it as a 1 day project
